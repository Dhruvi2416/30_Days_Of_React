        recepie:`Crush the spices. Break up the spices using a mortar and pestle into smaller pieces. \ Boil the water. Place a stainless steel or nonstick saucepan over high heat and add the water. Add a ¼ - ½ cup of water if your saucepan or pot has a large diameter to account for evaporation. As the water comes to a boil, add the spices and ginger so they can begin to release their flavor. \ Once the water comes to a boil, add the tea leaves or tea bag. Reduce the heat to low to medium. Let the tea steep with the spices for 2 minutes, no longer to prevent bitter tea. Then, add the milk. \ \ Pro tip: Using a stainless steel saucepan is best for making Masala Chai. Towards the end, you'll notice a bit of the milk may have burned or the tea leaves and spices are stuck to the side. This way, you can easily scrub off residue with a steel brush while washing dishes.`,
